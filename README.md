1) The project takes in the length of the triangle sides and return the type of the triangle(equilateral, isosceles or scalene).

2) All input fileds are validated by regular expression which can only be non-negative integar or float.

3) You can only submit after you type in the correct input format (e.g., 12, 1.3, 1.68). Otherwise the submit button is disabled.

4) Error messages will pop up if the input format is not correct.

5) Once the format of all three fields are correct, clicking submit will display the triangle type(equilateral, isosceles, scalene or not valid) at the bottom of the screen. If the given inputs cannot form a valid triangle, it will say "This is not a valid triangle".

6) bootstrap cdn is used for better visual effect.
